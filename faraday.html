 <p>The English chemist and physicist Michael Faraday, b. Sept. 22, 1791, d. Aug. 25, 1867, is known for his pioneering experiments in electricity and magnetism. Many consider him the greatest experimentalist who ever lived. Several concepts that he derived directly from experiments, such as lines of magnetic force, have become common ideas in modern physics. It means a lot to me to do a tribute to such a person. I graduated with my bachelors degree in physics so his theories and work mean that much more to me.
